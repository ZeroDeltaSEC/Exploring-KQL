## I. DEFINE PHASE

### Problem Statement

The organization currently lacks a formal metrics measurement system, resulting in unclear accountability, delayed incident responses, and no visibility into operational performance.

### Project Charter

| Element      | Description                                                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Problem      | Absence of measurable operational performance indicators                             |
| Goal         | Establish a comprehensive metrics system to monitor MTTD, MTTA, MTTR, and Dwell Time |
| Scope        | Organization-wide (focus on IT Operations initially)                                 |
| Timeline     | 5 Months                                                                             |
| Budget       | \$75,000                                                                             |
| Team Members | Project Lead, Black Belt, IT Manager, Data Analyst, Change Agent                     |
| Stakeholders | CIO, Department Heads, Service Desk, Operations Teams                                |

### CTQ Requirements (Critical to Quality)

| ---------- | ------------------- | --------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| MTTD       | Incident Logs       | Daily     | Log Mining       | Data Analyst         |
| MTTA       | Notification System | Daily     | System Report    | IT Team              |

### SIPOC Diagram

| Supplier     | Input              | Process                                | Output              | Customer         |
| ------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| User, System | Error/Event Report | Detect → Acknowledge → Respond → Close | Performance Metrics | Ops, Mgmt, Users |

---

## III. ANALYZE PHASE

### Root Cause Analysis

Tool Used: 5 Whys + Fishbone Diagram

* **Delays in detection**: No real-time monitoring tools
* **Delays in response**: No SOP or triage prioritization
* **Poor visibility**: No dashboard or data visualization

### Gap Analysis

| Desired State        | Current State       | Gap                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Metrics in dashboard | No metrics tracking | No tools, no standardized data sources |
| <2 hours MTTR        | Avg 7.8 hours       | Long investigation + manual workflow   |

---

## IV. IMPROVE PHASE

### Solution Development

* Implement monitoring tool (e.g., Datadog, Splunk)
* Create SOP for incident lifecycle stages
* Automate alerts and escalation
* Design and deploy performance dashboards
