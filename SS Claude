# AI PROMPT: Six Sigma Metrics Implementation Project

## ROLE DEFINITION
You are an expert Six Sigma Black Belt mentor with 15+ years of experience implementing DMAIC methodology across various industries. You specialize in process improvement, statistical analysis, and organizational change management.

## CONTEXT & REQUIREMENTS
I need you to create a comprehensive Six Sigma project for implementing a metrics measurement system in an organization that currently has NO established performance measurement processes.

## INPUT SPECIFICATIONS
**Based on this process flow:**
```
Thought Process Map
↓
Process Map  
↓
SIPOC
↓
FMEA
↓
Control Plan
```

**Focus on these key metrics:**
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA) 
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)
- Dwell Time

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

### 1. PROJECT STRUCTURE
Create a complete DMAIC project including:
- **DEFINE:** Problem statement, project charter, CTQ requirements, scope
- **MEASURE:** Data collection plan, baseline measurements, process mapping
- **ANALYZE:** Root cause analysis, statistical analysis, gap analysis
- **IMPROVE:** Solution development, implementation plan
- **CONTROL:** Control plan, sustainability strategy

### 2. DELIVERABLES FORMAT
- Professional project document in English
- Ready-to-implement templates and tools
- Practical checklists and forms
- Timeline with specific milestones
- Budget estimation and resource requirements

### 3. ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS
Include these essential elements:
- **SIPOC Diagram** - detailed supplier-input-process-output-customer analysis
- **FMEA Table** - comprehensive failure mode analysis with RPN calculations
- **Risk Mitigation Plan** - proactive risk management
- **Communication Plan** - stakeholder engagement strategy
- **Training Plan** - skill development approach
- **Control Charts Templates** - for ongoing monitoring

### 4. SUCCESS CRITERIA
The project should deliver:
- 95% compliance with established targets
- 50% reduction in response times  
- Sustainable measurement system
- Trained autonomous teams
- Measurable ROI and cost savings

### 5. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION
Ensure the project includes:
- **Week-by-week action plan** for 4-6 months
- **Role-specific responsibilities** clearly defined
- **Data collection templates** ready for immediate use
- **Dashboard mockups** for visualization
- **Change management strategy** for organizational adoption

## CONSTRAINTS & CONSIDERATIONS
- Organization has NO existing metrics measurement
- Budget should be realistic for mid-size company
- Timeline must be achievable with standard resources
- Focus on practical, implementable solutions
- Include both technical and behavioral change aspects

## EXPECTED EXPERTISE LEVEL
Demonstrate Six Sigma expertise through:
- Proper use of statistical terminology
- Industry best practices integration
- Realistic timelines and resource allocation
- Risk-aware implementation approach
- Sustainable process design

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Deliver as a comprehensive project document that can be:
- Presented to executive leadership
- Used as implementation roadmap
- Referenced by project team members
- Adapted for different organizational contexts
